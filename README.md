# FontAwesome-iOS #

FontAwesome-iOS takes the amazing font awesome (see that here: [FontAwesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) ) and makes it a simple category to make embedding the icons simple.

# Requirements/Dependencies  #

Requires that you embed and use the Font Awesome font in your app.

Requires at least iOS 5/OSX 10.7 or above. Also required is: https://github.com/daltoniam/FontAwesome-iOS.

How to add a custom font to iOS app:

1. Download the [FontAwesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) font.
2. Add that font files into your project using Xcode as a resource. Make sure it is part of the "Copy Bundle Resources" in the Build Phases.
3. Add a key to your Info.plist file called UIAppFonts. (Friendly name is: Fonts provided by application)
4. Make sure this key an array.
5. Enter the full name of your font file (including the extension) as an item to the UIAppFonts array. (Usually fontawesome-webfont.ttf)
6. Save your Info.plist.
7. Now in your application you can simply call [UIFont fontWithName:@"FontAwesome" size:12] to get the custom font to use with your UILabels and UITextViews, etcâ€¦
